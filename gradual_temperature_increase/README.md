These scripts were used to assess gene expression changes in responce to gradual temperature increase (0.8 degrees C per day) in *E. verrucosus*, *E. cyaneus*, and *G. lacustris* and filter ribosomal protein gene expression.
The files are numbered in accordance to their order in the pipeline. 3a and 3b produce nearly identical results but illutsrate the use of functions *vs*. code duplication.

This directory contains a bunch of scripts used for plotting data (https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-6024-3#Sec2). Might be mainly useful as a source of ggplot2 tricks.

`Fig_temperature.R` was used to create [Fig. 3A and 3B](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-6024-3/figures/3). An example of `scale_radius` usage.

`PCA_Cd_and_temp.R` is a prcomp analysis example.

`alignment_percent.R`, `correlation.R` and `intersections.R` speak for themselves and were used to plot ... respectively.

`plot_number_DE_genes.R  is just a generic script for plotting data from a table in a double-sided bar chart.
